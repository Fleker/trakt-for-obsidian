# Trakt for Obsidian

This project syncs your Trakt checkins to a file in Obsidian with date-specific backlinks. This can help you keep track of movies you've seen as well as when you've seen them.

## Example

You open up the command palette and run the **Trakt Sync: Sync watched history** command. It then fetches data and places it in a file called `Trakt Rating History.md` in a bulleted list.

```md

Finished watching Season 1, Episode 2 of [The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-secret-lives-of-mormon-wives) on [[2024-09-22]]
